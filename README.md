# Silence is Golden README

Spice up your npm package empty index.js file (or any other empty files) with a fun quote about silence. Type `Insert silence` in command pallette (mac:`cmd+shift+p` windows:`ctrl+shift+p`) to clear the document and insert a random quote.

- Get quotes from a quote API.

## Known Issues
